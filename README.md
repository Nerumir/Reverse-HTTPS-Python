Example of a HTTPS reverse shell made in Python. There is two files. A server file meant to open a server on the attacker machine and a client file meant to be run on the target machine.
I added one `download` command to the shell as a PoC.
It could be a good base to build a Python reverse shell with multiple commands and features even though Python is not a good choice for the client side payload.
